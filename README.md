# linalg

Simple linear algebra calculator

Most single matrix operations used in my Linear Algebra class implemented

...except for SVD because the numbers are way too ugly (e.g. 5/sqrt(6))


## Usage

- Select matrix w/ dropdown list
- Edit matrix
  - Separate elements with spaces
- Choose desired operation
- Result appears on right
